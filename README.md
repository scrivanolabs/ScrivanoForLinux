Scrivano is a notetaking application for handwritten notes. This repository contains the Linux builds for the application.
You can also download the app from Flathub by clicking the button below:

**NOTE**: The flatpak version of the app runs in a sandbox environment and it can only read/write files from these folders: xdg-desktop, xdg-documents, xdg-download and xdg-pictures. If you want to circumvent this for more freedom, you can use [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) to override these restrictions.

The Windows version can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9MWCLGJ5XCBS?cid=github_linux). Any feedback about the Linux version is very welcome.

Please note that Scrivano is not open source and this repository only contains the binary releases for the Linux version.

Scrivano offers a simple and easy to use interface to write down your thoughts and ideas. The app gives you an infinite vertical canvas (but limited horizontal space) without sacrificing the ability to easily export your documents in traditional printing formats (e.g. A2, A3, A4, etc...). 

Here is a summary of the most important features:
- **4 different paper backgrounds** to choose from: Plain, Lined, Grid or Dotted with customisable spacing.
- **Grid Snapping**: in Scrivano you can toggle the grid snapping feature so that your drawings will automatically snap to grid lines in the background. This is very useful to easily draw tables, diagrams and lines.
- **Automatic filling of strokes**: toggle the paint bucket in the toolbar to fill your drawing shapes and strokes.
- **Stickers**: save your frequently used symbols and diagrams, so you can easily drag and drop whenever you need them.
- **Insert images**: paste or drag and drop any image on the canvas to unleash your creativity!
- **Offline saving**: save your notes anywhere on your main drive, so you can manage them however you please.
- **Laser**: Scrivano offers a special laser tool to quickly draw over your notes. Incredibly useful when sharing your screen or presenting something!
- **PDF annotation**: you can import multiple PDF files and write over them with the built in inking tools.
